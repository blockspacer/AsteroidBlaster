AsteroidBlaster

Requirements:
Linux or Mac OS X
OpenGL 3.0 or above
SDL 1.2 or above
GNU make
gcc/g++

The first time you run this on any machine, compile libraries with 'make lib'. This should only be necessary once per hardware configuration.
Compile with 'make'. If your machine supports multithreading, use 'make -j'.
Run with 'make run'.

After the first time you run the game, you can change your configuration settings by editing 'config.cfg' in the main AsteroidBlaster folder.

This should work on Linux or OSX. It may compile on windows, but it currently does not run correctly.

Detailed information and commentary about the program and its code can be found in the accompanying website:
